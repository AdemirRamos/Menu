# Menu

This is a very simple menu I've done on my own just to add it to my portfolio and practice too. As I've just said, this is a pretty simple menu which is opened once the "humburger button" is clicked; when clicked, the "hamburger button" will move alongside the menu (both followed by a transition) and, once this button get reclicked, the menu will return to its original position.
